# JARVIS - Advanced AI Assistant Agent

## ü§ñ Introduction

JARVIS is a sophisticated AI assistant agent built using React and modern JavaScript technologies, leveraging the UpStreet SDK for streamlined agentic workflow. It's designed to be a versatile and powerful tool that can handle various tasks including file operations, terminal commands, AI-powered conversations, web scraping, internet searches, version control `Git` through seamless integration with Git, and controlling your PC to perform tasks as you like. This agent combines multiple cutting-edge technologies to provide a comprehensive solution for both developers and end-users.

## üåü Features Overview

JARVIS comes equipped with multiple powerful capabilities that make it a versatile AI assistant:

- File System Operations
- Terminal Command Execution
- AI-Powered Conversations (via Gemini)
- Ask questions with images to Gemini
- Web Scraping Capabilities
- Internet Search Integration
- File Encryption/Decryption
- Version Control through Git
- PC Control and Automation: execute tasks and control your computer as desired

## üìö Tools

### 1. File System Operations
The file system module provides comprehensive file handling capabilities:

#### Available Functions:
- `readFile`: Reads content from specified files
- `writeFile`: Creates or updates files with new content
- `listFiles`: Displays all files in the current directory
- `encryptFile`: Securely encrypts files using AES-256 (`Military grade Encryption`)
- `decryptFile`: Decrypts previously encrypted files

This tool allows JARVIS to interact with the file system, enabling it to read, write, and manage files as needed.

### 2. Terminal Command Execution
Secure and controlled terminal command execution with built-in safety features:

- Command execution with timeout protection
- Blocked dangerous commands for security
- Working directory context maintenance
- Detailed output capture (stdout and stderr)

This tool enables JARVIS to execute terminal commands in a secure and controlled environment, allowing it to perform tasks that require command-line interactions.

### 3. AI Conversation Module (Gemini Integration)
Advanced AI conversation capabilities powered by Google's Gemini:

- Real-time web searches
- Relevant result filtering
- Error handling
- Rate limiting protection

This tool allows JARVIS to perform web searches using Tavily, enabling it to find and retrieve relevant information from the internet.

### 7. File Encryption/Decryption
This feature enables JARVIS to encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256, ensuring the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data.

![File Encryption/Decryption](./images/file_encryption_decryption.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `encryptFile`: Encrypts a file using AES-256
- `decryptFile`: Decrypts a previously encrypted file

### 8. Version Control through Git
This feature enables JARVIS to interact with Git repositories, allowing it to perform version control tasks such as committing changes and pushing updates.

![Version Control through Git](./images/version_control_through_git.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `terminal`: Executes Git commands through the terminal tool

### 9. PC Control and Automation
This feature enables JARVIS to execute tasks and control the computer as desired, allowing it to automate tasks and perform system-level interactions.

![PC Control and Automation](./images/pc_control_and_automation.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `terminal`: Executes system-level commands through the terminal tool

## Version Control
JARVIS uses the terminal tool for version control, allowing it to execute Git commands and track changes, collaborate with other developers, and perform other version control tasks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- React development environment
- Required API keys:
  - Google API Key (for Gemini)
  - Tavily API Key (for web searches)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd agentX
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up UpStreet SDK:
```bash
npm install -g usdk
usdk login
```
