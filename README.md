- Text-based conversations
- Image analysis and processing
- Multi-modal interactions
- Context-aware responses

### 4. Web Scraping Capabilities
Robust web scraping functionality:

- URL content extraction
- Content analysis
- AI-powered content interpretation
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 5. Internet Search Integration
Integrated web search capabilities via Tavily:

- Real-time web searches
- Relevant result filtering
- Error handling
- Rate limiting protection

### 6. Security Features
Built-in security measures:

- AES-256-CBC encryption
- Secure key management
- Command execution safeguards
- Environment variable protection

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- React development environment
- Required API keys:
  - Google API Key (for Gemini)
  - Tavily API Key (for web searches)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd agentX
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### File Operations
```typescript
// Reading a file
await fileActions.readFile('example.txt');

// Writing to a file
await fileActions.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello, World!');

// Encrypting a file
await fileActions.encryptFile('sensitive.txt');
```

### AI Conversations
```typescript
// Text-based query
await geminiActions.askQuestion('What is the weather like today?');

// Image analysis
await geminiActions.askQuestionWithImage('What's in this image?', 'image.png');
```

### Web Operations
```typescript
// Web scraping
await scrapingActions.scrapeWebsite('Extract main content', 'https://example.com');

// Web search
await websearchActions.search('Latest AI developments');
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- All file operations are performed with proper error handling
- Terminal commands are filtered for potentially dangerous operations
- Encryption uses industry-standard AES-256-CBC
- API keys are protected through environment variables
- Input validation is implemented throughout the system
