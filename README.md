## ü§ñ Introduction

JARVIS is a sophisticated AI assistant agent built using React and modern JavaScript technologies, leveraging the UpStreet SDK for streamlined agentic workflow. It's designed to be a versatile and powerful tool that can handle various tasks including file operations, terminal commands, AI-powered conversations, web scraping, internet searches, version control `Git` through seamless integration with Git, and controlling your PC to perform tasks as you like. This agent combines multiple cutting-edge technologies to provide a comprehensive solution for both developers and end-users.

## üåü Features Overview

JARVIS comes equipped with multiple powerful capabilities that make it a versatile AI assistant:

- File System Operations
- Terminal Command Execution
- AI-Powered Conversations (via Gemini)
- Ask questions with images to Gemini
- Web Scraping Capabilities
- Internet Search Integration
- File Encryption/Decryption
- Version Control through Git
- PC Control and Automation: execute tasks and control your computer as desired

## üìö Features & Tools

### 1. File System Operations
The file system module provides comprehensive file handling capabilities:

![File Read](./images/file_read.png)

- `readFile`: Reads content from specified files

![File Write](./images/file_write.png)

- `writeFile`: Creates or updates files with new content

![List Files](./images/list_files.png)

- `listFiles`: Displays all files in the current directory

![Encrypt File](./images/encryption_decryption.png)

- `encryptFile`: Securely encrypts files using AES-256 (`Military grade Encryption`)

![File Content Before Encryption](./images/file_content_before_encryption.png)

- Example of file content before encryption

![File Content After Encryption](./images/file_content_after_encryption.png)

- Example of file content after encryption

![Decrypt File](./images/encryption_decryption.png)

- `decryptFile`: Decrypts previously encrypted files

This tool allows JARVIS to interact with the file system, enabling it to read, write, and manage files as needed.

### 2. Terminal Command Execution
Secure and controlled terminal command execution with built-in safety features:

![Terminal Command Execution](./images/terminal_tool.png)

- Command execution with timeout protection
- Blocked dangerous commands for security
- Working directory context maintenance
- Detailed output capture (stdout and stderr)

This tool enables JARVIS to execute terminal commands in a secure and controlled environment, allowing it to perform tasks that require command-line interactions.

### 3. AI Conversation Module (Gemini Integration)
Advanced AI conversation capabilities powered by Google's Gemini:

![Simple Gemini Call](./images/simple_gemini_call.png)

- Text-based conversations

![Gemini Chat with Image](./images/gemini_chat_with_image.png)

- Image analysis and processing
- Multi-modal interactions
- Context-aware responses

This tool allows JARVIS to engage in AI-powered conversations using Google's Gemini, enabling it to understand and respond to user queries in a more intelligent and context-aware manner.

### 4. Ask questions with images to Gemini
This feature enables JARVIS to ask questions with images to Gemini, allowing it to analyze and understand visual data.

![Gemini Chat with Image](./images/gemini_chat_with_image.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `askGeminiWithImage`: Asks Gemini a question with an image

### 5. Web Scraping Capabilities
Robust web scraping functionality:

![Web Scraping Capabilities](./images/scarping_tool.png)

- URL content extraction
- Content analysis
- AI-powered content interpretation
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

This tool enables JARVIS to extract and analyze content from web pages, allowing it to gather information and answer user queries more effectively.

### 6. Internet Search Integration
Integrated web search capabilities via Tavily:

![Internet Search Integration](./images/search_tool.png)

- Real-time web searches
- Relevant result filtering
- Error handling
- Rate limiting protection

This tool allows JARVIS to perform web searches using Tavily, enabling it to find and retrieve relevant information from the internet.

### 7. File Encryption/Decryption
This feature enables JARVIS to encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256, ensuring the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data.

![Encrypt File](./images/encryption_decryption.png)

- `encryptFile`: Encrypts a file using AES-256

![Decrypt File](./images/encryption_decryption.png)

- `decryptFile`: Decrypts a previously encrypted file

### 8. Version Control through Git
This feature enables JARVIS to interact with Git repositories, allowing it to perform version control tasks such as committing changes and pushing updates.

![Version Control through Git](./images/git.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `terminal`: Executes Git commands through the terminal tool

### 9. PC Control and Automation
This feature enables JARVIS to execute tasks and control the computer as desired, allowing it to automate tasks and perform system-level interactions.

![PC Control and Automation](./images/terminal_tool.png)

#### Available Functions:
- `terminal`: Executes system-level commands through the terminal tool

## Version Control
JARVIS uses the terminal tool for version control, allowing it to execute Git commands and track changes, collaborate with other developers, and perform other version control tasks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- React development environment
- Required API keys:
  - Google API Key (for Gemini)
  - Tavily API Key (for web searches)
  - JINA AI Reader API key (for web scraping)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Talha-Ali-5365/JARVIS.git
```

2. Set up UpStreet SDK:
```bash
npm install -g usdk
usdk login
usdk create JARVIS -y
```

`agent.tsx file will be created`

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd JARVIS
npm install @google/generative-ai
npm install @tavily/core
npm install axios
```

`NOTE: REPLACE THE agent.tsx file with one in repo`

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
